Plugin that allows you to input a list of postal / zip codes to block from ordering on your Woocommerce site. You can determine if you want to hide a payment gateway (i.e. credit card) or an outright block. You can now select multiple payment gateways to "remove" if the zip or postal code matches during the checkout process. An encrypted browser cookie is set that expires on a defined date, set by you in the admin settings. This means that you can "Ban" specific payment gateways for any number of days if the end-user's postal or zip code matches.

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### I tested it on myself and its not working for me! 

You should add a postal code (dont worry about spaces like L0L 0L0 versus L0L0L0, or case sensitivity). Then in a new browser (not logged in as admin) try to checkout with a blocked postal code.
